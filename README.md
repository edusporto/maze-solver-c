      * The maze.
   * The maze has the following requirements:
      * Must be the exact size given by the two other lines in the file;
      * Must contain an 'I', for IN (the entrance of the maze);
      * Must contain an 'O', for OUT (the exit of the maze);
      * Any character that isn't a blank space or an I or O will be treated as a wall.
